- [ ] Maybe have the basic stuff like nodemon, husky, lint-staged, etc... at the top level of the repo
- [ ] Remember to remove the eslint ignore in `index.ts` file
- [ ] Replace console.logs with logger
- [ ] Eventually move project wide dev dependencies and scripts to root of repo
- [ ] If doing config:update, update the script so that if it detects the database lines, it doesn't change them
